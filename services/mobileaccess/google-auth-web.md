# Enabling Google authentication for Web applications
{: #google-auth-web}

Use Google Sign-In to authenticate users on your Web application. Add {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} security functionality. 


## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

You must have:

* A Web app.
* An instance of a  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application that is protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service. For more information about how to create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} back-end application, see [Getting started](index.html).
* The URI for the final redirect (after the authorization process completes).


## Configuring a Google application for your website
{: #google-auth-config}

To start using Google as an identity provider, create a project in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com). Part of creating a project is to obtain a **Google Client ID** and **Secret**. The Google Client ID and Secret are the unique identifiers for your application used by Google authentication, and are needed for setting up the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard.

1. Open your Google application in the Google Developer Console. 
3. Add the **Google+** API. 
3. Create credentials using OAuth. Select Web application in application type. Enter the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} redirect URI in the Authorized redirect URIs box. Obtain the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} redirect authorization URI from the Google configuration screen of the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard (see steps that follow). 
4. Save changes. Note the **Google Client ID** and **Application Secret**.


## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Google authentication
{: #google-auth-config-ama}

After you have a Google Application ID and Secret, you can enable Google authentication in the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  dashboard.

1. Open the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service dashboard.
1. From the **Manage** tab, pull the **Authorization** lever to the **On** position.
1. Open the **Google** section.
1. Check the **Add Google to a Web App**
4. In the **Configure for Web** section:   
    * Note the value in the **Mobile Client Access Redirect URI for Google Developer Console** textbox. This is the value you need to add to the **Authorized redirect URIs**  box under **Restrictions in the Client ID for Web application**  of the **Google Developers Portal**.
    * Enter the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
    * Enter the redirect URI in the **Your Web Application Redirect URIs**. This value is for the redirect URI to be accessed after the authorization process is completed, and is determined by the developer.
5. Click **Save**.


## Implementing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} authorization flow using Google as identity provider
{: #google-auth-flow}

The `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable is created automatically for each {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service instance and contains properties necessary for the authorization process. It consists of a JSON object and can be viewed by clicking  **Service Credentials**  tab in the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service dashboard.

To start the process of authorization:

1. Retrieve the authorization endpoint (`authorizationEndpoint`) and clientId (`clientId`) from the service credentials stored in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. 
	`var cfEnv = require("cfenv");` 
	 `var mcaCredentials = cfEnv.getAppEnv().services.AdvancedMobileAccess[0].credentials;` 

	**Note:** If you added the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service to your application prior to adding Web support, you might not have token endpoint in service credentials. Instead, use the following URLs, depending on your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region: 
 
	US South: 

	`https://mobileclientaccess.ng.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/authorization` 

	London: 

	`https://mobileclientaccess.eu-gb.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/authorization` 

	Sydney: 

	`https://mobileclientaccess.au-syd.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/authorization`
	 
2. Build the authorization server URI using the `response_type("code")`, `client_id`, and `redirect_uri` as query parameters.

3. Redirect from your Web app to theÂ generated URI.
  
	The following example retrieves the parameters from the `VCAP_SERVICES` variable, building the URL, and sending the redirect request.
  
	```Java
	var cfEnv = require("cfenv"); 
	app.get("/protected", checkAuthentication, function(req, res, next) { 
		res.send("Hello from protected endpoint"); 
	}); 

	app.get("/protected", checkAuthentication, function(req, res, next) { 
		res.send("Hello from protected endpoint"); 
		function checkAuthentication(req, res, next) { 

			// Check if user is authenticated 
			if (req.session.userIdentity) { 
				next() 
			} else { 
				// If not - redirect to authorization server 
				var mcaCredentials = cfEnv.getAppEnv().services.AdvancedMobileAccess[0].credentials; 
				var authorizationEndpoint = mcaCredentials.authorizationEndpoint; 
				var clientId = mcaCredentials.clientId; 
				var redirectUri = "http://some-server/oauth/callback"; // Your Web application redirect URI 
				var redirectUrl = authorizationEndpoint + "?response_type=code";
				redirectUrl += "&client_id=" + clientId; 
				redirectUrl += "&redirect_uri=" + redirectUri; 
				res.redirect(redirectUrl); 
			} 
		} 
	}
	```
	{: codeblock}

	Note that the `redirect_uri` parameter represents your Web application redirect URI and must be equal to the one defined in the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard.

	After redirecting to the authorization end-point the user will get a login form from Google. After user grants permissions to be logged in using their Google identity, the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service calls your Web application redirect URI by supplying the grant code as a query parameter.

## Obtaining the tokens
{: #google-auth-tokens}

The next step is to obtain access token and identity tokens using the previously received grant code. 

1. Retrieve token `tokenEndpoint`, `clientId`, and `secret` from service credentials, stored in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable. 
 
	**Note:** If you used {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} before Web support was added, you might not have a token endpoint in service credentials. Instead, use the following URLs, depending on your Bluemix region: 

	US South: 
  
	`https://mobileclientaccess.ng.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/token`
 
	London: 
 
	`https://mobileclientaccess.eu-gb.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/token` 
 
	Sydney: 
 
	`https://mobileclientaccess.au-syd.bluemix.net/oauth/v2/token`

2. Send a post request to the token server URI with grant_type ("authorization_code"), client_id, redirect_uri, and code as form parameters. Send the `clientId` and `clientSecret` as Basic HTTP authentication credentials.
 
	The following code retrieves the necessary values, and sends them with a post request.
    
	```Java    
	var cfEnv = require("cfenv");
	var base64url = require("base64url ");
	var request = require('request');

	app.get("/oauth/callback", function(req, res, next) { 
		var mcaCredentials = cfEnv.getAppEnv().services.AdvancedMobileAccess[0].credentials; 
		var tokenEndpoint = mcaCredentials.tokenEndpoint; 
		var formData = { 
			grant_type: "authorization_code", 
			client_id: mcaCredentials.clientId, 
			redirect_uri: "http://some-server/oauth/callback",// Your Web application redirect uri 
			code: req.query.code 
		} 

		request.post({ 
			url: tokenEndpoint, 
			formData: formData 
		}, function (err, response, body) { 
			var parsedBody = JSON.parse(body); 
			req.session.accessToken = parsedBody.access_token; 
			req.session.idToken = parsedBody.id_token; 
			var idTokenComponents = parsedBody.id_token.split("."); // [header, payload, signature] 
			var decodedIdentity= base64url.decode(idTokenComponents[1]);
			req.session.userIdentity = JSON.parse(decodedIdentity)["imf.user"]; 
			res.redirect("/"); 
			}
			).auth(mcaCredentials.clientId, mcaCredentials.secret); 
		}
	); 
	```
	{: codeblock}

	The `redirect_uri` parameter is the URI for redirecting, after the successful or failed authentication with Google+, and must match the `redirect_uri` from step 1.  
   
	Make sure to send this POST request within 10 minutes after which the grant code expires. After 10 minutes, a new code is required.

	The POST response body contains the `access_token` and the `id_token` encoded in base64.

	When you have received access, and identity tokens, you can flag Web session as authenticated and optionally persist these tokens.  


##Using obtained access and identity token
{: #google-auth-using-token}

The identity token contains information about user identity. For Google authentication, the token contains all of the information the user agreed to share, such as full name, URL of the profile photo, and so on.  

The access token enables communications with resources that are protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} authorization filters. Read about [Protecting Resources](protecting-resources.html).

To make requests to protected resources, add an Authorization header to requests with the following structure: 

`Authorization=Bearer <accessToken> <idToken>`

####Tips:
{: #tips} 

* The `accessToken` and `idToken` must be separated by a white space.

* The `idToken` is optional. If you do not supply the identity token, the protected resource can be accessed, but it will not receive any information about the authorized user.
