# Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK
{: #getting-started}

You can set up your mobile app to use the  {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} SDK.  After you add the SDK, you can start setting up authentication and authorization for accessing your back-end application.  The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} SDK is available for Android, iOS, Cordova, and Web applications. A new Swift SDK has been released, making it easier to protect your back-end resources. Follow the instructions for adding the SDK, configuring your app to connect to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} services, and write code for accessing server resources.
