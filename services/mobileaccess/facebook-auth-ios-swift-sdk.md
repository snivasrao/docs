# Enabling Facebook authentication for iOS apps (Swift SDK)
{: #facebook-auth-ios}

To use Facebook as an identity provider in your {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} iOS applications, add and configure the iOS Platform for your Facebook application.
{:shortdesc}

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}

You must have
* An instance of an {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} service and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application. For more information about how to create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} back-end application, see [Getting started](index.html).
* The URL of your back-end application (**App Route**). You will need this values for sending requests to the protected endpoints of your back-end application.
* Your **TenantID** value. Open your service in the  {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard. Click the **Mobile Options** button. The `tenantId` (also known as `appGUID`)  value is displayed in the **App GUID / TenantId** field. You will need this value for intializing the Authorization Manager.
* Your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} **Region**. You can find your current {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region in the header, next to the **Avatar** icon ![Avatar icon](images/face.jpg "Avatar icon"). The region value that appears should be one of the following: `US South`, `United Kingdom`, or `Sydney`, and correspond to the SDK values required for the Swift SDK: `BMSClient.Region.usSouth`, `BMSClient.Region.unitedKingdom`, or `BMSClient.Region.sydney`. You will need this value for initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client.
* An iOS project that is seft up to work with CocoaPods.  For more information, see **Install CocoaPods** in  [Setting up the iOS Swift SDK](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/getting-started-ios-swift-sdk.html).  
   **Note:** You do not need to install the core {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  client SDK before proceeding.
* A Facebook application on the [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com)  site.


**Important:** You do not need to separately install the Facebook SDK (`com.facebook.FacebookSdk`). The Facebook SDK  installs automatically with the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod. You can skip the **Add the Facebook SDK to your Xcode Project** step when you add or configure your app on the Facebook for Developers website.

**Note:** While the Objective-C SDK remains fully supported, and is still considered the primary SDK for  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile Services, there are plans to discontinue the Objective-C SDK later this year in favor of this new Swift SDK.
## Configuring your Facebook Application for the iOS Platform
{: #facebook-auth-ios-config}
On the Facebook for Developers site:

1. Log in to your account on  [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com). For information on creating a new app, see [Creating an application on the Facebook for Developers website](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/facebook-auth-overview.html#facebook-appID). 

1. Ensure that the iOS platform has been added to your app. When you add or configure the iOS platform  you need to supply the **bundleId** of your iOS application. To find the **bundleId** of your iOS application, look for the **Bundle Identifier** in either the `info.plist` file or Xcode project **General** tab.

  **Tip**: Consider enabling URL Scheme Suffix or Single Sign On if you are planning to use these features.

1. Click **Save Settings**.

## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Facebook authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configmca}

After you  configure the Facebook App ID and your Facebook Application to serve iOS clients, you can enable Facebook authentication in your {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service.

1. Open your service in the  {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard.
1. From the **Manage** tab, pull the **Authorization** lever to the **On** position.
1. Expand the **Facebook** section.
1. Add the **Facebook Application ID** and click **Save**.

## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK for iOS
{: #facebook-auth-ios-sdk}

### Installing CocoaPods
{: #install-cocoapods}

1. Open Terminal and run the **pod --version** command. If CocoaPods is installed, the version number displays. You can skip to the next section to install the SDK.

1. If you do not have CocoaPods installed, run:

```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

For more information, see the [CocoaPods website](https://cocoapods.org/).

### Installing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK with CocoaPods
{: #facebook-auth-install-swift-cocoapods}

1. If you have no `Podfile` in your iOS project, run `pod init` to create the file.

1. Edit the `Podfile` and add the following lines:

 ```
use_frameworks!
pod 'BMSFacebookAuthentication'
	```
   **Note:** If you have this line in your Pod file: `pod 'BMSSecurity'`, you must remove it. The `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod installs all necessary frameworks.

   **Tip:** You can add `use_frameworks!` to your Xcode target instead of having it in the Podfile.

1. Save the `Podfile` and run the `pod install` command from the command line. CocoaPods installs the dependencies. The progress and which components were added are displayed.

 **Important**: You now must open your project by using the `xcworkspace` file that is generated by CocoaPods. Usually the name is `{your-project-name}.xcworkspace`.  

1. Run `open {your-project-name}.xcworkspace` from command line to open your iOS project workspace.

### Enable Keychain Sharing for iOS
{: #enable_keychain}

Enable `Keychain Sharing`. Go to the `Capabilities` tab and switch the `Keychain Sharing` to `On` in your Xcode project.



### Configuring your iOS project for Facebook Authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-configproject}

1. Find the `info.plist` file, usually located under `Supporting files` folder in your Xcode project.

1. Configure Facebook integration by adding the following properties to your `info.plist` file:

   ![image](images/ios-facebook-infoplist-settings.png)


   Update the URL scheme and FacebookAppID properties with your Facebook Application ID.

   You can also update the `info.plist` file by right-clicking the file, selecting **Open as > Source Code** and adding the following XML:

   ```XML
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>fb{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>
	<key>FacebookAppID</key>
	<string>{your-facebook-application-id}</string>
	<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
	<string>{your-faceebook-application-name}</string>
	<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
	<array>
		<string>fbauth</string>
		<string>fbauth2</string>
	</array>
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	<dict>
	    <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
	    <dict>
	        <key>facebook.com</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>                
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>fbcdn.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	        <key>akamaihd.net</key>
	        <dict>
	            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	            <true/>
	            <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
	            <false/>
	        </dict>
	    </dict>
	</dict>
```

   Update the `CFBundleURLSchemes` and `FacebookappID` properties with your Facebook Application ID. Update the `FacebookDisplayName` with the name of your Facebook application.

   **Important**: Make sure you are not overriding any existing properties in  the `info.plist` file. If you have overlapping properties, you must merge manually. For more information, see [Configure Xcode Project](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/) and [Preparing Your Apps for iOS9](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/ios9).

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Swift SDK
{: #facebook-auth-ios-initalize-swift}

Initialize the client SDK by passing the `tenantId`.

A common, though not mandatory, place to put the initialization code is in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your application delegate.


1. Import required framework in the class that you want to use {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK by adding the following headers:

 ```swift
 import UIKit
 import BMSCore
 import BMSSecurity
 ```
2. Initialize the client SDK.

 ```Swift
	let tenantId = "<serviceTenantID>"
	let regionName = <applicationBluemixRegion>

	func application(_ application: UIApplication,
	    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
		let mcaAuthManager = MCAAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance
   			 mcaAuthManager.initialize(tenantId: tenantId, bluemixRegion: regionName)
	//the regionName should be one of the following: BMSClient.Region.usSouth, BMSClient.Region.unitedKingdom, or BMSClient.Region.sydney
		BMSClient.sharedInstance.authorizationManager = mcaAuthManager

		FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.register()
	}

 ```

 In the code:

 * Replace `<applicationBluemixRegion>` with the region where your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application is hosted.
 * Replace `tenantId` with the **TenantId/App GUID** value.
 
 For more information about these values, see [Before you begin](#before-you-begin)).

1. Notify the Facebook SDK about the app activation and register the Facebook Authentication Handler by adding the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your app delegate. Add this code after you initialize the BMSClient instance and register Facebook as the authentication manager.

 ```Swift
  return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onFinishLaunching(application, withOptions: launchOptions)
 ```

1. Copy the `FacebookAuthenticationManager.swift` file from the `BMSFacebookAuthentication` pod source files to your project directory.

1. Add the following code to your app delegate.

 ```Swift

	func application(_ application: UIApplication, open url: URL,
                     sourceApplication: String?, annotation: Any) -> Bool {

        return FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.onOpenURL(application: application,
		url: url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)

    }
 ```

## Testing the authentication
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing}

After the client SDK is initialized and Facebook Authentication Manager is registered, you can start making requests to your mobile back-end application.

### Before you begin
{: #facebook-auth-ios-testing-before}

You must be using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} boilerplate and already have a resource protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} at the `/protected` endpoint. If you need to set up a `/protected` endpoint, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).

1. Try to send a request to protected endpoint of your newly created mobile back-end application in your browser. Open the following URL: `{applicationRoute}/protected`, replacing the `{applicationRoute}` with the value you retrieved from the **Mobile options** (see [Configuring Mobile Client Access for Facebook authentication](#facebook-auth-ios-configmca)).
For example: `http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected`
<br/>The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile back-end application that was created with MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}. An `Unauthorized` message is returned in your browser. This message is returned because this endpoint can be accessed only by mobile applications that are instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK.

1. Use your iOS application to make a request to the same endpoint.

	```Swift
	let protectedResourceURL = "<your protected resource absolute path>"
	let request = Request(url: protectedResourceURL, method: HttpMethod.GET)

	let callBack:BMSCompletionHandler = {(response: Response?, error: Error?) in
   		if error == nil {
			print ("response:\(response?.responseText), no error")
    		} else {
			print ("error: \(error)")
    			}
		}

	request.send(completionHandler: callBack)

 ```

1. Run your application. A Facebook login screen pops up.

   ![image](images/ios-facebook-login.png)

   This screen might look slightly different if you are not currently logged in to Facebook.

1. Click **OK** to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}  to use your Facebook user identity for authentication purposes.

1. 	When your request succeeds, the following output is displayed in the Xcode console:

 ```
 response:Optional("Hello, this is a protected resouce of the mobile backend application!"), no error

 ```
 {: screen}

1. You can also add logout functionality by adding the following code:

 ```
FacebookAuthenticationManager.sharedInstance.logout(callBack)
```


 If you call this code after a user is logged in with Facebook, and the user tries to log in again, they are prompted to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use Facebook for authentication purposes.

 To switch users, you must call this code and the user must log out from Facebook in their browser.

 Passing `callBack` to the logout function is optional. You can also pass `nil`.
