# Enabling Google authentication for iOS Objective C apps
{: #google-auth-ios}


Use Google Sign-In to authenticate users on your {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} iOS app.

**Note:** While the Objective-C SDK remains fully supported, and is still considered the primary SDK for  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile Services, there are plans to discontinue this SDK later this year in favor of the new Swift SDK. For new applications we highly recommend using the Swift SDK. The instructions on this page apply to the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client Objective-C SDK. For instructions on using the Swift SDK, see [Enabling Google authentication in iOS apps (Swift SDK)](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/google-auth-ios-swift-sdk.html).

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin}
You must have:
* An instance of an {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} service and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} application. For more information about how to create a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} back-end application, see [Getting started](index.html).
* The URL of your back-end application (**App Route**). You will need this values for sending requests to the protected endpoints of your back-end application.
* Your **TenantID** value. Open your service in the  {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard. Click the **Mobile Options** button. The `tenantId` (also known as `appGUID`)  value is displayed in the **App GUID / TenantId** field. You will need this value for intializing the Authorization Manager.

## Configuring a Google Project for the iOS Platform
{: #google-auth-ios-project}
To start using Google as identity provider, create a project in the Google Developer Console to obtain a Google client ID.  This client ID is a unique identifier to let Google know which application is attempting to connect.   

1. If you have not created a Google iOS project, follow the steps on the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) site.

1. From the **Social APIs** list, choose **Google+ API** and click **Enable**.

1. From the **Credentials** list, click the **Create credentials** button and choose **OAuth client ID**.

1. At this point you will be presented with an application type choice. Select **iOS**.

1. Provide a meaningful name for your iOS client. Specify the bundle ID of your iOS application. To find the bundle ID of your iOS application look for **Bundle Identifier** in either the `info.plist` file or the Xcode project **General** tab.

1. Take note of your new Google iOS client ID. You need the value when you set up the application in  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}.




## Configuring {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} for Google authentication
{: #google-auth-ios-config}

Now that you have a Google iOS client ID, you can enable Google authentication in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard.

1. Open your service in the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} dashboard.
1. From the **Manage** tab, pull the **Authorization** lever to the **On** position.
1. Expand the **Google** section.
1. In **Application ID for iOS**, specify your Google client ID for iOS.
1. Click **Save**.


## Configuring the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} Google client SDK for iOS
{: #google-auth-ios-sdk}

### Installing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK using CocoaPods
{: #google-auth-ios-sdk-cocoapods}

1. Navigate to your iOS project.

1. Edit the `Podfile` to add the following line:

	```
	pod 'IMFGoogleAuthentication'
	```
{: codeblock}

1. Save the `Podfile` and run `pod install` from the command line. CocoaPods  installs the dependencies. You will see the progress and which components were added.

  **Important**: You now must open your project by using the `xcworkspace` file that is generated by CocoaPods. Usually the name is `{your-project-name}.xcworkspace`.  

1. Run `open {your-project-name}.xcworkspace` from the command line to open your iOS project workspace.

### Configuring iOS project for Google Authentication
{: #google-auth-ios-googleauth}
Configure Google integration by updating the `info.plist` file. The `info.plist` file is usually in the `Supporting files` folder in your Xcode project. You can either edit the file in the property list editor or with a text editor.

* Configure Google integration by adding the following URL schemas to your `info.plist` file.
	![info.plist file](images/ios-google-infoplist-settings.png)

	The first URL Schema is a reversed version of the client ID from the Google Developer Console.  For example, if your client ID is `123123-abcabc.apps.googleusercontent.com`, your URL Schema is: `com.googleusercontent.apps.123123-abcabc`.

	The second URL Schema is the bundle ID of your application.

* Use a text editor. Right-click `info.plist` and select **Open as > Source code**. Add the following XML to the file:

	```XML
	<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
	<array>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
			<string>Editor</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>com.googleusercontent.apps.123123-abcabc</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
		<dict>
			<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
			<string>Editor</string>
			<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
			<array>
				<string>com.ibm.HelloWorld</string>
			</array>
		</dict>
	</array>

	```
{: codeblock}

	Update both URL Schemas.

	**Important**: Do not override any existing properties in the `info.plist` file. If you have overlapping properties, you will need to merge the properties manually. For more information, see [Try Sign-In for iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start).

## Initializing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK
{: #google-auth-ios-initialize}

To use the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK,  initialize it by passing the TenantID, and App Route parameters.

A common, though not mandatory, place to put the initialization code is in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your application delegate.

1. Import the required frameworks in the class where you want to use the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK. Add the following headers:

	#### Objective-C:

	```Objective-C
	#import <IMFCore/IMFCore.h>
	#import <IMFGoogleAuthentication/IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler.h>
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	The {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK is implemented with Objective-C. You might need to add a bridging header to your Swift project to use the SDK.

	1. Right-click your project in Xcode and select **New File...**.

	2. In the **iOS Source** category, pick **Header file**.

	3. Name it `BridgingHeader.h`.

	4. Add the following imports to your bridging header:
		
	   `#import <IMFCore/IMFCore.h>`
		
	   `#import <IMFGoogleAuthentication/IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler.h>`
	
	5. Click your project in Xcode and select the **Build Settings** tab.

	6. Search for `Objective-C Bridging Header`.

	7. Set the value to the location of your `BridgingHeader.h` file, for example: `$(SRCROOT)/MyApp/BridgingHeader.h`.

	8. Make sure your bridging header is being picked up by Xcode by building your project.

3. Use the following code to initialize the client SDK.  Replace `<applicationRoute>` and `<TenantID>` with your **Route** and **TenantID**.

	#### Objective-C:

	```Objective-C
	[[IMFClient sharedInstance]
			initializeWithBackendRoute:@"<applicationRoute>"
			backendGUID:@"<TenantID>"];
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	```Swift
	IMFClient.sharedInstance().initializeWithBackendRoute("<applicationRoute>",
	 							backendGUID: "<TenantID>")
	```
{: codeblock}

1. Initialize the `AuthorizationManager` by passing the {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} service `tenantId` parameter. 
  ####Objective-C
	
  ```Objective-C

  	   [[IMFAuthorizationManager sharedInstance]  initializeWithTenantId: @"tenantId"];
  ```
 {: codeblock}

  ####Swift

  ```Swift
	   IMFAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance().initializeWithTenantId("tenantId")
  ```
 {: codeblock}

1. Register Google Authentication Handler by adding the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in your app delegate. Add this code immediately after you initialize the IMFClient:

	#### Objective-C:

	```Objective-C
	[[IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler sharedInstance] registerWithDefaultDelegate];
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	```Swift
	IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler.sharedInstance().registerWithDefaultDelegate()
	```
{: codeblock}

1. Add the following code to your app delegate.

	#### Objective-C:

	```Objective-C
	- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication *)application {
		[[IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler sharedInstance] handleDidBecomeActive];
	}

	- (BOOL)application: (UIApplication *)application openURL: (NSURL *)url
					sourceApplication: (NSString *)sourceApplication annotation: (id)annotation {

		BOOL shouldHandleGoogleURL = [GPPURLHandler handleURL:url
					sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];

		[[IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler sharedInstance] handleOpenURL:shouldHandleGoogleURL];
		return  shouldHandleGoogleURL;
	}
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	```Swift
	func application(application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL,
					sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject) -> Bool {

		let shouldHandleGoogleURL = GPPURLHandler.handleURL(url,
				sourceApplication: sourceApplication, annotation: annotation)

		IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler.sharedInstance()
							.handleOpenURL(shouldHandleGoogleURL)

		return shouldHandleGoogleURL;
	}
```
{: codeblock}

## Testing the authentication
{: #google-auth-ios-testing}
After the client SDK is initialized, you can start making requests to your mobile backend.

### Before you begin
{: #google-auth-ios-testing-before}
You must be using the {{site.data.keyword.mobilefirstbp}} boilerplate and already have a resource protected by {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} at the `/protected` endpoint. If you need to set up a `/protected` endpoint, see [Protecting resources](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/mobileaccess/protecting-resources.html).


1. Try to send a request to protected endpoint of your mobile backend in your desktop browser by opening `{applicationRoute}/protected`, for example `http://my-mobile-backend.mybluemix.net/protected`

1. The `/protected` endpoint of a mobile backend created with MobileFirst Services Boilerplate is protected with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}}, therefore it can only be accessed by mobile applications instrumented with {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} client SDK. As a result you will see `Unauthorized` in your desktop browser.

1. Use your iOS application to make request to the same endpoint.

	#### Objective-C:

	```Objective-C
	NSString *requestPath = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/protected",
								[[IMFClient sharedInstance] backendRoute]];

	IMFResourceRequest *request =  [IMFResourceRequest requestWithPath:requestPath
																method:@"GET"];

	[request sendWithCompletionHandler:^(IMFResponse *response, NSError *error) {
		if (error){
			NSLog(@"Error :: %@", [error description]);
		} else {
			NSLog(@"Response :: %@", [response responseText]);
			NSLog(@"%@", [[IMFAuthorizationManager sharedInstance] userIdentity]);
		}
	}];
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	```Swift
	let requestPath = IMFClient.sharedInstance().backendRoute + "/protected"

	let request = IMFResourceRequest(path: requestPath, method: "GET");
	request.sendWithCompletionHandler { (response, error) -> Void in
		if (nil != error){
			NSLog("Error :: %@", error.description)
		} else {
			NSLog("Response :: %@", response.responseText)
			NSLog("%@", IMFAuthorizationManager.sharedInstance().userIdentity)
		}
	};

	```
{: codeblock}

1. Run your application. You will see a Google Login screen pop-up

	![image](images/ios-google-login.png)

	This screen might look slightly different if you do not have the Facebook app installed on your device, or if you are not currently logged in to Facebook.

1. By clicking **OK** you're authorizing {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use your Google user identity for authentication purposes.

1. 	Your request should succeed. You should see the following output in the LogCat

	![image](images/ios-google-login-success.png)
		
	You can also add logout functionality by adding the following code:

	#### Objective C:

	```Objective-C
	[[IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler sharedInstance] logout : callBack]
	```
{: codeblock}

	#### Swift:

	```Swift
	IMFGoogleAuthenticationHandler.sharedInstance().logout(callBack)
	```
{: codeblock}

	If you call this code after a user is logged in with Google and the user tries to log in again, they are prompted to authorize {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} to use Google for authentication purposes. At that point, the user can click the user name <!--in the upper-right corner of the screen--> to select and login with another user.

	Passing `callBack` to the logout function is optional. You can also pass `nil`.
